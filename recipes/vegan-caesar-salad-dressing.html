    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A creamy, hummus-based vegan Caesar Dressing in just 5 minutes with simple ingredients! The perfect plant-based
        dressing for salads.</p>
    <p>This dressing would be perfect on hearty salads, especially kale that’s been massaged with a little lemon and
        olive oil. Throw on some vegan parmesan cheese and it’ll taste just like the real thing – promise.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup plain houmous</li>
        <li>1 tsp spicy mustard</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tsp capers</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp maple syrup</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To a small mixing bowl, add hummus, spicy mustard, lemon zest + juice, minced capers + brining juice, and
            minced garlic, and whisk thoroughly to combine. Olive oil is optional, but will add a bit more creaminess.
        </li>
        <li>Add a little hot water to thin until pourable and whisk until creamy and smooth (see photo). Taste and
            adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt and pepper, lemon juice, or minced garlic if desired! Maple syrup
            will help offset how salty and briney this dressing is, if you find you need it (I did not).</li>
        <li>Use immediately, or store in the refrigerator up to 5-7 days.</li>
        <li>This dressing is delicious on kale, romaine, and arugula. It would also be great on roasted vegetables,
            especially Brussels sprouts and potatoes. Top with a little vegan parmesan cheese for the ultimate Caesar
            salad experience.</li>
    </ol>
